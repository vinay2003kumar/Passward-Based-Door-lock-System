# Passward-Based-Door-lock-System
Basic Arduino Programming based project

Password Based Door Lock System is designed using ARDUINO   UNO   where   in   once   the   correct   code   or password   is   entered,   the   door   is   opened   and   the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Password Based Door Lock System using Arduino UNO is a simple project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system. Old fashioned lock systems use mechanical locking and these can be replaced by new advanced techniques of locking systems. These methods are a  combination  of  mechanical  and  electronic  devices and are highly intelligent. One of the distinct features of these intelligent lock systems is their simplicity and high efficiency. 
In this project, an Arduino serves as the program's brain, controlling the entire system with 94% accuracy. The system includes a control unit, a lock mechanism, and enhanced security features. 
The project's essential components include the Arduino microcontroller, Arduino IDE for programming, a keypad for input, a servo motor for the lock mechanism, an LCD for display, and a potentiometer for adjustments.
